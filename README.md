#  Video Game Sales Analysis

This project explores a large dataset of video game sales to uncover trends in global gaming markets, platform performance, genre popularity, and regional preferences. The analysis provides actionable insights for publishers, developers, and marketers.

##  Project Overview

Video games have become a dominant entertainment medium worldwide. Understanding sales patterns can help stakeholders make informed decisions about game development and marketing strategies.

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of video game sales data to uncover:

- Global and regional sales trends  
- Genre and platform popularity  
- Correlation between critic/user scores and sales  
- Year-wise performance and market evolution  
- Outliers and anomalies in sales data  

The goal is to identify patterns that explain what drives successful game sales.

##  Project Objectives

- Load and inspect the raw video game sales dataset  
- Clean missing values, correct datatypes, and remove duplicates  
- Engineer additional fields (e.g., Year Groups, Popularity Categories)  
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
- Generate meaningful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- Summarize insights and highlight correlations  
- Export a fully cleaned dataset for future modeling

##  Key Insights

- Action and Sports genres dominate global sales.  
- North America leads in sales, followed by Europe and Japan.  
- Nintendo and Sony platforms consistently outperform others in lifetime sales.  
- Critic scores show moderate correlation with global sales; user scores have weaker influence.  
- Sales peaked between 2008–2010, then declined steadily.  
- Outliers include blockbuster titles with massive global reach (e.g., Wii Sports, GTA V).
